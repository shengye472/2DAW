Version 2

Interviewer: Good morning, Mr. [Last Name]. Thank you for applying for the Minesweeper Technician position at MinasCorp. Can you tell me about your experience?

Candidate: Good morning! I’ve worked in logical minefield exploration for five years. I specialize in expert-level grids and can clear a 16x30 field in under three minutes.

Interviewer: Impressive. What’s your strategy for navigating an unknown minefield?

Candidate: I start in a corner or center, clear safe areas quickly, and use number patterns to locate mines.

Interviewer: What’s the trickiest pattern you’ve (encountered / find) ?

Candidate: The 1-2-1 pattern near a mine row—it often forces a risky guess. I try to gather more info before making a move.

Interviewer:  If you found yourself in a situation where a single step would detonate a mine but you didn't have enough information, what would you do?

Candidate: I’d consult my team, analyze the grid, and if needed, request a controlled detonation.

Interviewer: Now, suppose your team is assigned a highly unstable grid with moving mines. How would you adapt to this new variant?

Candidate: I’d use dynamic sensors to track movement and predict safe paths.

Interviewer: What if a teammate marks a mine incorrectly?

Candidate: I’d double-check and correct it immediately. One mistake can cost the mission.

Interviewer: (I like your approach / All right). Your logical skills and teamwork abilities are exactly what we’re looking for at MinasCorp. We’ll be in touch soon.

Candidate: Thank you! Looking forward to it.
